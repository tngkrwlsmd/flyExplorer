# flyExplorer current status — 2026-10-03

## Product source of truth

main is the canonical C++/WinRT WinUI 3 product. Product code lives in
app/winui, UI-independent native code in src/base, tests in tests/winui, and
bounded orchestration in tools/winui/run_checks.py. The former MFC application
is retired from the working tree and is recoverable from Git revision cbffb48.

The current product architecture includes the completed V8-A through V8-E
controller-extraction cycle: WindowWorkspaceController, SessionCoordinator,
ShellNavigationController, FileOperationController and SearchController. A
post-extraction MainWindow audit also moved the coherent file-detail worker
lifecycle into FileDetailController. A second responsibility audit selected
preferences persistence as the next justified ownership boundary and moved its
revision/mutex/detached-save lifecycle into PreferencesCoordinator. A follow-up
workspace-restore lifecycle audit then found an independent request/settlement
boundary and moved pane-local restore sequencing into
WorkspaceRestoreCoordinator. Live Git refs always take precedence over recorded
checkpoints.

## Accepted current behavior

- Windows 11-style WinUI 3 shell with custom title bar/Mica, navigation,
  address/search, command bar, status surface and independent dual panes.
- Functional top-level Window Tabs plus per-pane folder tabs.
- V8-A extracts live WindowTab/Pane/PaneTab state-transition ownership into the
  UI-independent WindowWorkspaceController under app/winui; MainWindow keeps
  XAML presentation plus Shell/watcher side effects.
- V8-B extracts private-session capture/save/load/restore/clear generation and
  close invalidation into the UI-independent SessionCoordinator under app/winui.
  MainWindow now keeps only session-related XAML projection, status and
  Shell/watcher side effects.
- V8-C ShellNavigationController owns isolated Shell navigation, supervisor,
  filesystem/Shell namespace watchers and stale route/request handling.
- V8-D FileOperationController owns transfer/file-command worker lifecycle,
  cancellation, stale completion and collision/recycle continuations.
- V8-E SearchController owns bounded search request identity, cancellation,
  stale completion rejection and recent-scope persistence.
- The first post-extraction audit identified file-detail work as one remaining
  independent lifecycle boundary. FileDetailController now owns pane-local
  cancellation, detached detail workers and bounded Shell visual/thumbnail
  orchestration. MainWindow retains request preparation, live PaneState
  acceptance, DispatcherQueue handoff and XAML projection.
- The second MainWindow responsibility audit compared preferences persistence,
  private drag/drop state and workspace restore sequencing. Preferences was the
  strongest independent persistence/lifetime boundary: PreferencesCoordinator
  now owns the Preferences value, write mutex, revision ordering and detached
  atomic-save worker. MainWindow retains theme/view presentation, request
  initiation and DispatcherQueue-projected save-failure status.
- A follow-up owned physical-drag probe intentionally did not extract drag/drop.
  On the Release test-owned window the Korean source row was visible, enabled
  and explicitly selectable, and real mouse press/move/release coordinates were
  delivered. However neither the row nor ListView DragStarting diagnostic
  status appeared, so DragOver/Drop were never reached. A final identical
  retry reproduced the same boundary. This does not prove a product drag defect;
  it means the current automation environment cannot certify the
  pointer-to-WinUI-drag gesture boundary.
- The follow-up workspace-restore audit reversed the earlier deferral after
  identifying a real lifecycle boundary: each pane has queued restore tasks plus
  one awaited Shell navigation request. Previously a failed/rejected/no-change
  restore request could clear the model pending flag without advancing the raw
  queue, leaving later tabs unrestored. WorkspaceRestoreCoordinator now owns
  restore tasks, awaited request identity, settle/advance matching and
  reset/cancel semantics. MainWindow keeps workspace/model application, Shell
  submission and presentation. Stale or canceled completions cannot advance a
  restore lane, while a matching failed/rejected/no-change completion can
  continue remaining tabs.
- Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab Window Tab behavior.
- Details, List, Small Icons, Medium Icons and Large Icons views.
- Back/Forward/Up, filtering/sorting, local create/rename, guarded copy/move/
  recycle flows, Windows clipboard/context integration, isolated Shell visuals
  and directory/Shell namespace watching.
- Private session schema v2 persists/restores the active Window Tab, per-tab
  split state/ratio and active pane, both panes' tabs, selected tabs,
  view/sort/name-column state and bounded filesystem Back/Forward history.
  Legacy session v1 remains readable.
- ko-KR is the default app-owned UI language.

## Shell and shutdown safety

Potentially blocking Shell/provider work must not execute synchronously on the
XAML UI thread. FlyShellIsolationHelper.exe and bounded native worker paths
provide the process/thread fault boundary.

The v7 session acceptance exposed a repeatable close race with
CoreMessagingXP.dll / 0xC000027B and WER 0x800710DD
(ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION). Cancellation/shutdown remains at the window Closed
boundary. V8-B moves session epoch/revision invalidation into
SessionCoordinator::prepareForClose(); detached session workers retain only
shared native generation state and post through a close-safe callback supplied
by MainWindow. FileDetailController now owns pane-local detail cancellation and
the detached metadata/icon/thumbnail worker lifecycle. MainWindow still performs
the live route/tab/ticket acceptance before projecting a completion, and
PrepareForClose cancels detail work before ShellNavigationController shutdown.
Accepted GUI evidence requires real process exit code 0.

## Build and test environment

Canonical Windows full builds now have one explicit toolchain contract:
- Visual Studio/MSBuild 18.x;
- MSVC v145 x64 tools;
- Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0.

VS 2022/v143 is not claimed as a supported full-build path. The app, Shell
helper, M19-M23 native fixtures and installer template use v145 consistently.
MSBuild discovery verifies the x64 compiler/toolset/SDK, and the app build
verifies the restored WinUI/XAML assets after NuGet restore.

Direct NuGet references are Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK 2.5.1,
Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT 2.0.250303.1,
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools 10.0.26100.9169 and
Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary 1.0.260126.7. Actual transitive restore
is verified from project.assets.json rather than inferred from these four
references.

Source-only contracts are suitable for a non-Windows/Python stdlib environment.
Product compilation/execution requires Windows. GUI automation additionally
requires the pinned tests/winui/requirements-gui.txt set and an interactive
Windows desktop. Debug is framework-dependent; Release is self-contained but
still requires its complete sibling runtime/resources.

The previously described external install_script/start_skill cloud bootstrap
files are not present in this repository. This repository therefore documents
the required environment but does not claim to have modified external cloud
bootstrap configuration.

## Latest verified evidence

Large Icons is accepted on product revision
`aafa1615048c61aade0cd1c544990735ddb89a15`, with policy-reviewed main revision
`8fedf10aa3ead00b9488be0176da08dcd419ddf6`. Automatic self-hosted Windows run
`37110339453` completed successfully on 2026-10-03 with resolved scope
`release-gui`:
- policy validation: PASS;
- canonical structure preflight: 4/4 PASS;
- source contracts: 174/174 PASS;
- Release M20 native state fixture: 26/26 PASS;
- canonical Release app build: PASS;
- owned Release GUI validation: PASS with
  `REAL_M23_PRIVATE_SESSION_CLEAR_REVOKES_FUTURE_AUTO_RESTORE True`,
  `OWNED_WINUI_SHELL_EXIT 0` and
  `ORIGINAL_SIX_USER_CONFIG_SHA256_IDENTICAL True`;
- Release runtime-set verification: PASS.

The Large Icons acceptance used an owned Windows 11 Explorer baseline at
972x720, 96 DPI and Dark theme. Explorer Large Icons measured about 105x131 px
per UIA item with roughly 118x132 px pitch. flyExplorer uses a 112x128 item in a
120x132 wrap slot, retaining a 64 px visual target and two-line label while
keeping dual-pane density practical.

The PreferencesCoordinator logical unit was pre-main validated on temporary
remote run `37096260604`: focused coordinator contracts 2/2 PASS, canonical
structure 4/4 PASS, source contracts 154/154 PASS, Release build PASS, full
owned Release GUI PASS, real process exit 0, protected user configuration
unchanged and `git diff --check` PASS.

Earlier FileDetailController evidence remains valid for its own unchanged
revision. The broader Debug/package/install evidence from run `37020993308`
remains historical and was not rerun for this behavior-preserving architecture
work. DPI scaling, accessibility, physical drag, signing and public
distribution remain separate gates.

## Known functional coverage limits

Current source and the last parity evidence still show these limits:
- Shell enumeration is bounded at 2,600 entries; larger folders, streaming
  virtualization, network/virtual providers and sustained thumbnail-cache
  behavior are not certified.
- Persistent bookmark edit/import/delete and bookmark toolbar parity are not
  implemented in the current WinUI product.
- Search is bounded filename search; content search, regex and advanced
  multi-criteria search are not implemented.
- Saved filter/mask rule sets and the complete historical command/provider
  verb/fault matrix are not implemented or not fully tested.
- User-configurable accelerators and a complete historical shortcut map are
  not implemented.

## Packaging state

The installer project is now reproducible from a tracked project template, and
a current local Release setup build plus bounded /TESTROOT install/uninstall
has passed. The tracked licensing/provenance snapshot still predates v7, so
this does not by itself clear public distribution or prove a signed clean-machine
machine-wide install/update/rollback path.

## Open gates

Not certified by current automated evidence:
- actual 125%, 150% and 200% OS display scaling;
- High Contrast ON;
- human Narrator and Korean IME composition acceptance;
- physical pointer drag acceptance (owned Release automation reaches a visible,
  enabled, selected source row and real mouse movement, but not WinUI
  DragStarting; product defect versus automation/input limitation remains
  unresolved);
- signed clean-machine machine-wide install/update/rollback;
- public redistribution/source-delivery/rightsholder/legal clearance;
- optional path-specific Known Folder artwork.

Do not convert source support, RDP-only checks or a prior package into
certification of these gates.
